"""
The project says we needs to display some sort of analysis of the data.

Given that the project is uploading stuff to the AWS, this analysis should
probably used SELECT statements and such, performing analysis all-at-once,
rather than storing the analysis locally (which could work, but we might get
docked points).

Due to the unimplemented nature of the project, I don't even know where to
begin with a template for this, since I can't get away with just making an
'analyze()' function like in `processing.py`. So no template for now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
